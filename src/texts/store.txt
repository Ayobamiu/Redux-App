We can configure our store in many ways
1. store\
    bugs\
        actions.js
        actionTypes.js
        reducer.js
    projects\
        actions.js
        actionTypes.js
        reducer.js
    auth\
        actions.js
        actionTypes.js
        reducer.js
2.  store\
        bugs.js
        projects.js
        auth.js

Method No 2 is called Dusk pattern, where we put our actions, actionTypes and reducers in one single file. That makes debugging easier.

When using Method 2;
    1. Export your reducer as the default Export
    2. Export individual action Creators
    3. No need to export the actionTypes

Creating Store.
1. using createStore 
    import { createStore } from 'redux';
    const store = createStore(reducer, **middleware, **reduxDevTools);

2. using configureStore
